## Description

> Challenge #9 ReadMe Generator

## Introduction 
This week we were instructed to create an app that will allow us to create a ReadMe.md file from the command line only. Taking information in from the prompts to add custom information to the document.

## Challenges

There were a couple of challenges i ran into while working on this project. I still am a little confused about module exports and combining different code.

## Victories

I really enjoyed looking up the understanding of markdown syntax. Its like a very washed out version of basic html and it is always really fun to see the hard code next to the preview and how much prettier it will look.
